## Codebase state

All functions are working as intended. However, for now, the codebase still contains unused code from the original project (10ten), making it much more complex than necessary. Some components have been repurposed but still retain their original names. For details, check [notes.md](notes.md).

## Credits

This project started as a fork of the [10ten Japanese Reader](https://github.com/birchill/10ten-ja-reader) project. So, huge thanks to the author [@birtles](https://github.com/birtles) for his wonderful work. It has served as the perfect cross-platform base for LingLook. I recommend anyone who is learning Japanese to check out his project.
